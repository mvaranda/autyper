# autyper

This is a Native front-end for Mozilla's DeepSpeech project. Autyper will convert audio files (MP3, Wav, Ogg, Flac... etc) as well as input audio sources (microphone) to text documents. A simple installer will be provided for Windows/Mac/Linux; models can be friendly downloaded/managed using the UI dialogs.

### Note: This project is in its very earlier stages of development; it is not usable yet as the focus is to prototype the core functionality.
I will update this README as soon as I have something usable.
