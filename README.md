# autyper

This is a Native front-end for Mozilla's DeepSpeech project. Autyper converts MP3 audio files to text; later will also support Wav, Ogg, Flac... etc as well as input audio sources (microphone). A simple installer is provided for Windows (later Mac/Linux); models can be friendly managed using the UI dialogs.
